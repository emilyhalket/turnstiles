## turnstiles
### exploring subway turnstile data

This is a __work in progress__! Getting practice playing with a large, imperfect dataset and also building skills in python.

Also, please note that there are some issues viewing the notebooks in chrome, but they were able to load for me in firefox. Hopefully, I'll find a fix so that they can be viewed in either.
